# Bluetooth HCI Packet Logger

This project collects different tools to capture Bluetooth HCI Packet Logs using external hardware. They share a common library for writing log files.

Suppported Capture Tools:
- [TotalPhase Beagle USB Protocol Analyzer series](totalphase-beagle-usb). For USB Bluetooth, the (smallest) Beagle USB 12 device is sufficient.
- [Salea Logic Logic analyzer](salea-logic-uart) series to analyze UART trace
- [Windows USBpcap](windows-usbpcap) to analyze USB traces on Windows.
